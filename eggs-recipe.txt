Gordon Ramsey’s Scrambled Eggs

Ingredients:

6 large free-range eggs
3Tbs ice-cold butter diced
1-2  tbsp crème fraîche
Freshly ground sea salt and pepper (you can use regular salt if you need to)
Few chives, snipped (substitute with green onion if necessary)

Method:

1. Break the eggs into a cold, heavy-based pan, add the chunks of butter, and place onto the stove over generous heat. Using a spatula, stir the eggs frequently to combine the yolks with the whites.

2. As the mixture begins to set, keep moving the pan off and back on the heat.

3. Add the crème fraîche and season the eggs at the last minute with salt & pepper, then fold in the snipped chives. Serve immediately.

**Optional: Serve with: vine of tomatoes, roasted as-is in a pan; mushroom caps, roasted as-are in same pan; toasted chunky slices of French bread or similar (rustic).**
